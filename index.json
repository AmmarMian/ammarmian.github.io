sensing data from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors offer a unique opportunity to record, to analyze, and to predict the evolution of the Earth. In the last decade, numerous satellite remote sensing missions have been launched (Sentinel-1, UAVSAR, TerraSAR X, etc.). This resulted in a dramatic improvement in the Earth image acquisition capability and accessibility. The growing number of observation systems allows now to build high temporal/spatial-resolution Earth surface images data-sets. This new scenario significantly raises the interest in time-series processing to monitor changes occurring over large areas. However, developing new algorithms to process such a huge volume of data represents a current challenge. In this context, the present thesis aims at developing methodologies for change detection in high-resolution SAR image time series.These series raise two notable challenges that have to be overcome:On the one hand, standard statistical methods rely on multivariate data to infer a result which is often superior to a monovariate approach. Such multivariate data is however not always available when it concerns SAR images. To tackle this issue, new methodologies based on wavelet decomposition theory have been developed to fetch information based on the physical behavior of the scatterers present in the scene.On the other hand, the improvement in resolution obtained from the latest generation of sensors comes with an increased heterogeneity of the data obtained. For this setup, the standard Gaussian assumption used to develop classic change detection methodologies is no longer valid. As a consequence, new robust methodologies have been developed considering the family of elliptical distributions which have been shown to better fit the observed data.The association of both aspects has shown promising results in change detection applications.","tags":["Robust statistics","Covariance homogeneity","Low-rank","Change-point estimation","Synthetic Aperture Radar","Change detection","Lower-bounds","Riemannian geometry","Machine learning","Ph.D"],"title":"Contributions to SAR Image Time Series Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ammar Mian","Arnaud Breloy","Guillaume Ginolhac","Jean-Philippe Ovarlez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566864000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566864000,"objectID":"eaddaa0509a77c4f90a66da42a0ac089","permalink":"https://ammarmian.github.io/publication/gretsi_2019/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gretsi_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Robust Low-rank tests for change detection.","tags":["Robust statistics","Low-rank","Synthetic Apreture Radar","Change detection","Ph.D"],"title":"D√©tection de Changement Robuste en Rang Faible pour les S√©ries Temporelles d'Images SAR","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ammar Mian","Arnaud Breloy","Guillaume Ginolhac","Jean-Philippe Ovarlez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561593600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561593600,"objectID":"9d15055823422e4a1880c9fc145ecf95","permalink":"https://ammarmian.github.io/publication/igarss_2019/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/igarss_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Robust Low-rank tests for change detection.","tags":["Robust statistics","Low-rank","Synthetic Aperture Radar","Change detection","Ph.D"],"title":"Robust Low-rank Change Detection for SAR Image Time Series","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ammar Mian","Lucien Bacharach","Guillaume Ginolhac","Alexandre Renaux","Mohammed Nabil El Korso","Jean-Philippe Ovarlez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1557619200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557619200,"objectID":"29d0fcbce9ce854f64c9b47084a3286b","permalink":"https://ammarmian.github.io/publication/icassp_2019/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icassp_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Hybrid Cramer-Rao/Weiss-Weinstein bound for SAR applications.","tags":["Lower-Bounds","Change-point estimation","Ph.D"],"title":"Designing SAR Images Change-point Estimation Strategies Using an Mse Lower Bound","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ammar Mian","Jean-Philippe Ovarlez","Guillaume Ginolhac","Abdourahmane Atto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554984000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554984000,"objectID":"5bc761042167185829f57e76301ecf1b","permalink":"https://ammarmian.github.io/talk/change-detection-for-sar-images/","publishdate":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/change-detection-for-sar-images/","section":"event","summary":"A tutorial on change detection for SAR images.","tags":["Synthetic Aperture Radar","Change detection","Ph.D"],"title":"Change detection for SAR Images","type":"event"},{"authors":["Ammar Mian","Jean-Philippe Ovarlez","Guillaume Ginolhac","Abdourahmane Atto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554895800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554895800,"objectID":"fd2eedc5a01351037ad364741ef04635","permalink":"https://ammarmian.github.io/talk/robust-statistics-for-testing-the-homogeneity-of-covariance-scale-and-shape/","publishdate":"2019-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/robust-statistics-for-testing-the-homogeneity-of-covariance-scale-and-shape/","section":"event","summary":"A talk about statistics for change detection on High Resolution SAR images.","tags":["Robust statistics","Covariance homogeneity","Change detection","Ph.D"],"title":"Robust statistics for testing the homogeneity of covariance scale and shape","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;

Lanc√©e en Juillet 2014, cette mission est d√©di√©e √† l‚Äôestimation du vent et de la rugosit√© de la surface oc√©anique. La charge utile SGR-ReSI (Space GNSS Receiver Remote Sensing Instrument) fournit des formes d‚Äôondes sous forme de cartes d√©lai-Doppler (DDM). Ces mesures sont issues des r√©flexions des signaux GPS en visibilit√©, allant jusqu‚Äô√† quatre mesures simultan√©es, et sont mises √† disposition de la communaut√© scientifique. Nous proposons d‚Äôanalyser ces mesures bistatiques en bande L dans la perspective d‚Äôun large spectre d‚Äôapplications possibles. Apr√®s un effort de collecte des donn√©es (calibration, mesures ancillaires, ...), nous √©tudions la capacit√© √† observer la surface oc√©anique en fournissant un premier ordre de la performance (erreur de mesure) et de la r√©solution spatiale associ√©e.
