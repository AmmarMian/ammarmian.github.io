Classical methodologies based on covariance matrix analysis are usually built upon the Gaussian assumption, as well as an unstructured signal model. Both of these hypotheses may be inaccurate for high-dimension/resolution images, where the noise can be heterogeneous (non-Gaussian) and where all channels are not always informative (low-rank structure). In this paper, we tackle these two issues by proposing a new detector assuming a robust low-rank model. Analysis of the proposed method on a UAVSAR dataset shows promising results.","tags":null,"title":"Robust Low-rank Change Detection for SAR Image Time Series","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554735600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554735600,"objectID":"80663d93783ae029779ea08c61b45e96","permalink":"https://ammarmian.github.io/talk/presentation_overview_cd/","publishdate":"2019-04-09T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/presentation_overview_cd/","section":"talk","summary":"In this talk we consider an overview of change detection techniques for SAR images.","tags":[],"title":"Change detection for SAR Images","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554735600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554735600,"objectID":"2b8ee966ed5d3f63310c613e7105347f","permalink":"https://ammarmian.github.io/talk/presentation_nus/","publishdate":"2019-04-09T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/presentation_nus/","section":"talk","summary":"In this talk we consider the problem of testing the homogeneity/equality of covariance matrices under a complex elliptical model.

Although the methodologies of change-point estimation have already been investigated in the literature, there are, to the best of our knowledge, no study on the expected performance for the estimation of change-points in a Wishart distributed time series. This is mainly due to the fact that few results exist on change-point estimation performance in the mathematical literature: the classical central limit theorem does not apply and the classical Cramer-Rao Bound does not exist due to the discrete nature of the parameters. To fill this gap, this paper proposes to use a lower-bound on the Mean Square Error (MSE) with fewer regularity conditions. To this end, recent works on hybrid Cramer-Rao/Weiss-Weinstein bound have been adapted to the specific SAR problematic of interest. Since estimation strategies usually rely on a set of parameters which have to be set by the user, we show how the proposed lower bound allows performing an appropriate tuning. Moreover, the proposed bound is computationally efficient which enables an extensive analysis without a high computational cost.","tags":null,"title":"Designing SAR Images Change-Point Estimation Strategies using an MSE Lower Bound","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rayen Ben Abdallah","Ammar Mian","Arnaud Breloy","Abigael Taylor","Mohammed Nabil El Korso","David Lautru"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1545782400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545782400,"objectID":"cea41ad3a6324959a65b7ff30aafba0e","permalink":"https://ammarmian.github.io/publication/grsl_2019/","publishdate":"2018-12-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/grsl_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Testing the similarity of covariance matrices from groups of observations has been shown to be a relevant approach for change and/or anomaly detection in synthetic aperture radar images. While the term “similarity” usually refers to equality or proportionality, we explore the testing of shared properties in the structure of low rank plus identity covariance matrices, which are appropriate for radar processing. Specifically, we derive two new generalized likelihood ratio tests to infer i) on the equality of the low rank signal component of covariance matrices, and ii) on the proportionality of the low rank signal component of covariance matrices. The formulation of the second test involves non-trivial optimization problems for which we tailor efficient Majorization-Minimization algorithms. Eventually, the proposed detection methods enjoy interesting properties, that are illustrated on simulations and on an application to real data for change detection.","tags":null,"title":"Detection Methods Based on Structured Covariance Matrices for Multivariate SAR Images Processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ammar Mian","Jean-Philippe Ovarlez","Abdourahmane M.

These behaviors present an interesting source of diversity for target detection schemes. Unfortunately, such characteristics have been integrated and have been naturally lost in monovariate single look SAR images. Modeling this behavior as non-stationarity, wavelet analysis has been successful in retrieving this information. However, the sharp-edge of the used wavelet functions  introduces undesired high side-lobes for the strong scatterers present in the images. In this paper, a new family of parametrized wavelets, designed specifically to reduce those side-lobes in the SAR image decomposition, is proposed. Target detection schemes are then explored using this spectro-angular diversity and it can be shown that in High-Resolution SAR images, the non-Gaussian and robust framework leads to better results.","tags":null,"title":"Design of New Wavelet Packets Adapted to High-Resolution SAR Images with an Application to Target Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ammar Mian","Guillaume Ginolhac","Jean-Philippe Ovarlez","Abdourahmane M.

Classical change detection schemes have modelled the data as a realisation of Gaussian random vectors and have derived statistical tests under this assumption. However, when considering high-resolution images, the heterogeneous behaviour of the scatterers is not well described by a Gaussian model. In this paper, the data model is extended to Spherically Invariant Random Vectors where the heterogeneity of the images is accounted for through a deterministic texture parameter. Then three separate detection problems are considered and generalised likelihood ratio test technique is used to derive statistical tests for each problem. The constant false alarm rate property of the new statistics are studied both theoretically and through simulation. Finally, the performance of the new statistics are studied both in simulation and on real synthetic aperture radar data and compared to Gaussian-derived ones.
