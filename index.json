While the term “similarity” usually refers to equality or proportionality, we explore the testing of shared properties in the structure of low rank plus identity covariance matrices, which are appropriate for radar processing. Specifically, we derive two new generalized likelihood ratio tests to infer i) on the equality of the low rank signal component of covariance matrices, and ii) on the proportionality of the low rank signal component of covariance matrices. The formulation of the second test involves non-trivial optimization problems for which we tailor efficient Majorization-Minimization algorithms. Eventually, the proposed detection methods enjoy interesting properties, that are illustrated on simulations and on an application to real data for change detection.","tags":null,"title":"Detection Methods Based on Structured Covariance Matrices for Multivariate SAR Images Processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ammar Mian","Jean-Philippe Ovarlez","Abdourahmane M.

These behaviors present an interesting source of diversity for target detection schemes. Unfortunately, such characteristics have been integrated and have been naturally lost in monovariate single look SAR images. Modeling this behavior as non-stationarity, wavelet analysis has been successful in retrieving this information. However, the sharp-edge of the used wavelet functions  introduces undesired high side-lobes for the strong scatterers present in the images. In this paper, a new family of parametrized wavelets, designed specifically to reduce those side-lobes in the SAR image decomposition, is proposed. Target detection schemes are then explored using this spectro-angular diversity and it can be shown that in High-Resolution SAR images, the non-Gaussian and robust framework leads to better results.","tags":null,"title":"Design of New Wavelet Packets Adapted to High-Resolution SAR Images with an Application to Target Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ammar Mian","Guillaume Ginolhac","Jean-Philippe Ovarlez","Abdourahmane M.

Classical change detection schemes have modelled the data as a realisation of Gaussian random vectors and have derived statistical tests under this assumption. However, when considering high-resolution images, the heterogeneous behaviour of the scatterers is not well described by a Gaussian model. In this paper, the data model is extended to Spherically Invariant Random Vectors where the heterogeneity of the images is accounted for through a deterministic texture parameter. Then three separate detection problems are considered and generalised likelihood ratio test technique is used to derive statistical tests for each problem. The constant false alarm rate property of the new statistics are studied both theoretically and through simulation. Finally, the performance of the new statistics are studied both in simulation and on real synthetic aperture radar data and compared to Gaussian-derived ones. The study yields promising results when the data are heterogeneous.","tags":null,"title":"New Robust Statistics for Change Detection in Time Series of Multivariate SAR Images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ammar Mian","Jean-Philippe Ovarlez","Guillaume Ginolhac","Abdourahmane M.
