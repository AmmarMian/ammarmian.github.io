While the term “similarity” usually refers to equality or proportionality, we explore the testing of shared properties in the structure of low rank plus identity covariance matrices, which are appropriate for radar processing. Specifically, we derive two new generalized likelihood ratio tests to infer i) on the equality of the low rank signal component of covariance matrices, and ii) on the proportionality of the low rank signal component of covariance matrices. The formulation of the second test involves non-trivial optimization problems for which we tailor efficient Majorization-Minimization algorithms. Eventually, the proposed detection methods enjoy interesting properties, that are illustrated on simulations and on an application to real data for change detection.","tags":null,"title":"Detection Methods Based on Structured Covariance Matrices for Multivariate SAR Images Processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ammar Mian","Jean-Philippe Ovarlez","Abdourahmane M.

These behaviors present an interesting source of diversity for target detection schemes. Unfortunately, such characteristics have been integrated and have been naturally lost in monovariate single look SAR images. Modeling this behavior as non-stationarity, wavelet analysis has been successful in retrieving this information. However, the sharp-edge of the used wavelet functions  introduces undesired high side-lobes for the strong scatterers present in the images. In this paper, a new family of parametrized wavelets, designed specifically to reduce those side-lobes in the SAR image decomposition, is proposed. Target detection schemes are then explored using this spectro-angular diversity and it can be shown that in High-Resolution SAR images, the non-Gaussian and robust framework leads to better results.","tags":null,"title":"Design of New Wavelet Packets Adapted to High-Resolution SAR Images with an Application to Target Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ammar Mian","Jean-Philippe Ovarlez","Guillaume Ginolhac","Abdourahmane M.

We extend existent works to take into account the heterogeneity of the dataset on a spatial neighborhood. The classic complex Gaussian assumption of the data is replaced by a complex elliptically symmetric assumption. Then robust statistics are derived using Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT). These statistics are coupled to an estimation strategy for one or several changes. Performance of these robust statistics have been analyzed in simulation and compared to the one associated with standard multivariate normal assumption. When the data is heterogeneous, the detection and estimation strategy yields better results with the new statistics.","tags":null,"title":"Robust Detection and Estimation of Change-Points in a Time Series of Multivariate Images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ammar Mian","Jean-Philippe Ovarlez","Guillaume Ginolhac","Abdourahmane M.
