Classical change detection schemes have modelled the data as a realisation of Gaussian random vectors and have derived statistical tests under this assumption. However, when considering high-resolution images, the heterogeneous behaviour of the scatterers is not well described by a Gaussian model. In this paper, the data model is extended to Spherically Invariant Random Vectors where the heterogeneity of the images is accounted for through a deterministic texture parameter. Then three separate detection problems are considered and generalised likelihood ratio test technique is used to derive statistical tests for each problem. The constant false alarm rate property of the new statistics are studied both theoretically and through simulation. Finally, the performance of the new statistics are studied both in simulation and on real synthetic aperture radar data and compared to Gaussian-derived ones. The study yields promising results when the data are heterogeneous.","tags":null,"title":"New Robust Statistics for Change Detection in Time Series of Multivariate SAR Images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ammar Mian","Jean-Philippe Ovarlez","Guillaume Ginolhac","Abdourahmane M.

We extend existent works to take into account the heterogeneity of the dataset on a spatial neighborhood. The classic complex Gaussian assumption of the data is replaced by a complex elliptically symmetric assumption. Then robust statistics are derived using Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT). These statistics are coupled to an estimation strategy for one or several changes. Performance of these robust statistics have been analyzed in simulation and compared to the one associated with standard multivariate normal assumption. When the data is heterogeneous, the detection and estimation strategy yields better results with the new statistics.","tags":null,"title":"Robust Detection and Estimation of Change-Points in a Time Series of Multivariate Images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ammar Mian","Jean-Philippe Ovarlez","Guillaume Ginolhac","Abdourahmane M.
