abstract = "A new Riemannian geometry for the zero-mean Compound Gaussian distribution with deterministic textures is proposed. In particular, the Fisher information metric (up to a factor) is obtained, along with corresponding geodesics and distance function. This new geometry is applied on a change detection problem on Multivariate Image Times Series: a recursive approach based on Riemannian optimization is developed. As shown on simulated data, it allows to reach optimal performance while being computationally more efficient."
